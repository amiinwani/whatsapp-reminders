```

## 🚀 Two Ways to Get Your APK

### Option 1: Quick Build (Recommended) 
**Use GitHub Actions or online build service:**

1. Upload this `@APP` folder to GitHub
2. Use GitHub Actions to build the APK automatically
3. No local Android setup needed!

### Option 2: Local Build
**Set up Android development environment:**

1. **Install Java JDK 11+**
   ```bash
   # macOS
   brew install openjdk@11
   
   # Add to your ~/.zshrc or ~/.bash_profile:
   export JAVA_HOME=$(/usr/libexec/java_home -v11)
   ```

2. **Install Android Studio**
   - Download from: https://developer.android.com/studio
   - Install Android SDK (API level 33+)
   - Set ANDROID_HOME environment variable

3. **Build the APK**
   ```bash
   cd /Users/arhamwani/whatsapp-reminder/@APP
   cd android
   ./gradlew assembleDebug
   ```

4. **Get your APK**
   - Location: `android/app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk`
   - Install on your Android device!

## 📋 Alternative: Use the Build Script

I've created an automated build script for you:

```bash
cd /Users/arhamwani/whatsapp-reminder/@APP
./build.sh
```

This script will:
- Check system requirements
- Build the APK automatically  
- Copy it to `WhatsApp-Reminder.apk` in the root directory
