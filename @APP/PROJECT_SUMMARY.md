## 🚀 How It Works

### **Authentication Flow**
1. App opens → Tap "Connect WhatsApp Web"
2. Opens WhatsApp Web in browser
3. Scan QR code with your phone's WhatsApp  
4. Return to app → Connection saved

### **Creating Reminders**
1. Enter contact phone number (+1234567890 format)
2. Type your reminder message
3. Set frequency (how often to send)
4. Optionally set time range (e.g., 9 AM - 6 PM only)
5. Tap "Start Reminder"

### **Automated Messaging**
1. App runs in background continuously
2. At scheduled intervals, opens WhatsApp via `wa.me` links
3. Pre-fills message and recipient
4. Sends notification when message delivered
5. Updates statistics in real-time

### **Background Operation**
- Uses Android foreground services
- Continues working when app is minimized
- Survives phone restarts (if enabled)
- Shows notifications for sent messages
